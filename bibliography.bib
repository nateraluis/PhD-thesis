	Abstract = {Models of street networks underlie research in urban travel behavior, accessibility, design patterns, and morphology. These models are commonly defined as planar, meaning they can be represented in two dimensions without any underpasses or overpasses. However, real-world urban street networks exist in three-dimensional space and frequently feature grade separation such as bridges and tunnels: planar simplifications can be useful but they also impact the results of real-world street network analysis. This study measures the nonplanarity of drivable and walkable street networks in the centers of 50 cities worldwide and then examines the variation of nonplanarity across a single city. It develops two new indicators---the Spatial Planarity Ratio and the Edge Length Ratio---to measure planarity and describe infrastructure and urbanization. While some street networks are approximately planar, we empirically quantify how planar models can inconsistently but drastically misrepresent intersection density, street lengths, routing, and connectivity.},

@book{Jacobs1961,
	Abstract = {Includes index. Jane Jacobs critiques the
                   comprehensive modernist approach to urban planning
                   after 1945. By the 1950s, various American cities
                   were pursuing ambitious urban renewal policies,
                   influenced by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier's
                   concept of the "Radiant City." Jacobs sees this being
                   utterly at odds with urban realities, and leading to
                   the destruction of the city as a living community.
                   This futurist vision insisted on the absolute
                   segregation of the city's different activities into
                   separate zones, linked (though also physically
                   isolated) by super-highways set in wide parkland
                   landscaping. The colossal physical destruction that
                   was necessary to implement this vision tore apart the
                   traditional multi-activity street and densely
                   populated neighborhood that Jacobs avers is the
                   bedrock of urban living. Peculiar nature of cities:

@article{Gossling2016,
	Abstract = {? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&}
                   Francis Group.In many cities of the world, road space
                   is increasingly contested. Growing vehicle numbers,
                   traffic calming and the development of new
                   infrastructure for more sustainable transport modes
                   such as bicycles have all contributed to pressure on
                   available space and conflicts over the allocation of
                   space. This paper provides the first assessment of
                   urban transport infrastructure space distribution,
                   distinguishing motorized individual transport, public
                   transport, cycling and walking. To calculate area
                   allocation, an assessment methodology was developed
                   using high-resolution digital satellite images in
                   combination with a geographical information system to
                   derive area measurements. This methodology was
                   applied to four distinctly different city quarters in
                   Freiburg, Germany. Results indicate that space is
                   unevenly distributed, with motorized individual
                   transport being the favoured transport mode. Findings
                   also show that if trip number to space allocation
                   ratios are calculated, one of the most sustainable
                   transport modes, the bicycle, is the most
                   disadvantaged. This suggests that area allocation
                   deserves greater attention in the planning and
                   implementation of more sustainable urban transport
                   designs.},

@article{Szell2018,
	Abstract = {Most cities are car-centric, allocating a privileged
                   amount of urban space to cars at the expense of
                   sustainable mobility like cycling. Simultaneously,
                   privately owned vehicles are vastly underused,
                   wasting valuable opportunities for accommodating more
                   people in a livable urban environment by occupying
                   spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven
                   quantification and visualization of such urban
                   mobility space inequality is lacking, here we explore
                   how crowdsourced data can help to advance its
                   understanding. In particular, we describe how the
                   open-source online platform What the Street!? uses
                   massive user-generated data from OpenStreetMap for
                   the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility
                   spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms,
                   the platform rearranges all parking and mobility
                   spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles of a city to be
                   directly comparable, making mobility space inequality
                   accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced
                   method confirms a prevalent imbalance between modal
                   share and space allocation in 23 cities worldwide,
                   typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the
                   guesses of the platform's visitors about mobility
                   space distributions, we find that this discrimination
                   is consistently underestimated in the public opinion.
                   Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which
                   extensive parking areas are regained through fleets
                   of shared, autonomous vehicles. We outline how such
                   accessible visualization platforms can facilitate
                   urban planners and policy makers to reclaim road and
                   parking space for pushing forward sustainable
                   transport solutions.},

	Abstract = {Transport processes on spatial networks are
                   representative of a broad class of real world systems
                   which, rather than being independent, are typically
                   interdependent. We propose a measure of utility to
                   capture key features that arise when such systems are
                   coupled together. The coupling is defined in a way
                   that is not solely topological, relying on both the
                   distribution of sources and sinks, and the method of
                   route assignment. Using a toy model, we explore
                   relevant cases by simulation. For certain parameter
                   values, a picture emerges of two regimes. The first
                   occurs when the flows go from many sources to a small
                   number of sinks. In this case, network utility is
                   largest when the coupling is at its maximum and the
                   average shortest path is minimized. The second regime
                   arises when many sources correspond to many sinks.
                   Here, the optimal coupling no longer corresponds to
                   the minimum average shortest path, as the congestion
                   of traffic must also be taken into account. More
                   generally, results indicate that coupled spatial
                   systems can give rise to behavior that relies subtly
                   on the interplay between the coupling and randomness
                   in the source-sink distribution.},

	Abstract = {Most large cities are spanned by more than one
                   transportation system. These different modes of
                   transport have usually been studied separately: it is
                   however important to understand the impact on urban
                   systems of the coupling between them and we report in
                   this paper an empirical analysis of the coupling
                   between the street network and the subway for the two
                   large metropolitan areas of London and New York. We
                   observe a similar behaviour for network quantities
                   related to quickest paths suggesting the existence of
                   generic mechanisms operating beyond the local
                   peculiarities of the specific cities studied. An
                   analysis of the betweenness centrality distribution
                   shows that the introduction of underground networks
                   operate as a decentralising force creating
                   congestions in places located at the end of
                   underground lines. Also, we find that increasing the
                   speed of subways is not always beneficial and may
                   lead to unwanted uneven spatial distributions of
                   accessibility. In fact, for London -- but not for New
                   York -- there is an optimal subway speed in terms of
                   global congestion. These results show that it is
                   crucial to consider the full, multimodal, multi-layer
                   network aspects of transportation systems in order to
                   understand the behaviour of cities and to avoid

                   layer and one in which lines of the same
                   transportation mode are grouped together, we study
                   the interconnected structure of 9 different cities in
                   Europe raging from small towns to mega-cities like
                   London and Berlin highlighting their vulnerabilities
                   and possible improvements. Finally, for the city of
                   Zaragoza in Spain, we also consider data about
                   service schedule and waiting times, which allow us to
                   create a simple yet realistic model for urban
                   mobility able to reproduce real-world facts and to
                   test for network improvements.},

	Abstract = {One day in 2005, a bench, some grass, and a tree
                   suddenly appeared on a parking spot in central San
                   Francisco. The parking meter was paid for two hours,
                   and after that the installation disappeared. This
                   action by the art-design-activist organization Rebar
                   has led to the annual global event Park(ing) Day and
                   an official planning program in San Francisco, From
                   Pavements to Parks, inspiring cities around the world
                   to introduce their own parklet projects.Many cities
                   are facing challenges such as economic deficits and a
                   lack of open public spaces, and growing concerns
                   exist regarding the need for urban greenery. This
                   paper discusses how parklets are challenging the role
                   of public spaces and urban nature, drawing on
                   discussions and conceptualizations of publicness,
                   observational data, literature review, and document
                   analysis to explore the influence of parklets as an
                   urban design strategy at a local and global level.The
                   symbolic change from parking space to public park
                   space and the tactical urbanism inspiration of the
                   concept constitute both parts of the symbolic value
                   of parklets. At the same time, the line between
                   community activism and urban strategy has been
                   blurred. The city reviews, permits, and inspects the
                   projects; and the sponsor is responsible for the
                   design, financing, maintenance, and liability. The
                   paper concludes that, even though parklets might
                   provide a new public space and bring greenery to
                   streetscapes, publicness, roles and responsibility,
                   as well as the functionality of nature in these

	Abstract = {Background: Many cities across the world are
                   beginning to shift their mobility solution away from
                   the private cars and towards more environmentally
                   friendly and citizen-focused means. Hamburg, Oslo,
                   Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their
                   plans to become (partly) private car free cities.
                   Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar,
                   Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad
                   have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic
                   including implementing car free days, investing in
                   cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization,
                   restricting parking spaces and considerable increases
                   in public transport provision. Such plans and
                   measures are particularly implemented with the
                   declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
                   These reductions are also likely to benefit public
                   health. Aims: We aimed to describe the plans for
                   private car free cities and its likely effects on
                   public health. Methods: We reviewed the grey and
                   scientific literature on plans for private car free
                   cities, restricted car use, related exposures and
                   health. Results: An increasing number of cities are
                   planning to become (partly) private car free. They
                   mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in
                   city centers. The likely effects of such policies are
                   significant reductions in traffic-related air
                   pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers.
                   For example, up to a 40{\%} reduction in NO 2 levels
                   has been reported on car free days. These reductions
                   are likely to lead to a reduction in premature
                   mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in
                   the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the
                   need for parking places and road space, provides
                   opportunities to increase green space and green
                   networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many
                   beneficial health effects. All these measures are
                   likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility
                   and physical activity which may improve public health
                   the most and also provide more opportunities for
                   people to interact with each other in public space.
                   Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a
                   sufficiently large scale can result in positive
                   distal effects and climate change mitigation through
                   CO 2 reductions. The potential negative effects which
                   may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around
                   car free zone into their destinations also need
                   further evaluation and the areas in which car free
                   zones are introduced need to be given sufficient
                   attention so as not to become an additional way to
                   exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and
                   magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear
                   and needs further research, including full chain
                   health impact assessment modeling to quantify the
                   potential health benefits of such schemes, and
                   exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any
                   changes when such interventions take place.
                   Conclusions: The introduction of private car free
                   cities is likely to have direct and indirect health
                   benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential
                   conflicting effects are as yet unclear. This paper
                   has overviewed the expected health impacts, which can
                   be useful to underpin policies to reduce car use in
                   cities.},

                   bicycle. The presence of a striped lane or separated
                   path can increase a cyclist's perception of safety.
                   With growing concerns over traffic congestion and
                   vehicle pollution, public policy makers are
                   increasingly promoting bicycling as an alternative
                   for commuting and other utilitarian trip purposes.
                   States and local spending on bicycle facilities has
                   increased significantly over the past decade.
                   Previous studies have linked higher levels of bicycle
                   commuting to various demographic and geographic
                   variables. At least one analysis showed that cities
                   with higher levels of bicycle infrastructure (lanes
                   and paths) also saw higher levels of bicycle
                   commuting. This research affirms that finding by
                   analyzing data from 35 large cities across the U.S.
                   This cross-sectional analysis improves on previous
                   research by including a larger sample of cities, not
                   including predominantly `college towns,' and using
                   consistent data from the Census 2000 Supplemental

	Abstract = {Cities promote strong bicycle ``networks'' to support
                   and encourage bicycle commuting. However, the concept
                   of a ``network'' of bicycle facilities is not very
                   well studied. Previous work has found relationships
                   between the amount of bicycle infrastructure in a
                   city and bicycle ridership. This study shifts the
                   focus from sheer quantity of bicycle infrastructure
                   to functional connectivity using network science
                   concepts and measurement techniques from other
                   transportation modes. It fills a gap in the bicycling
                   literature by developing a standard methodology for
                   measuring bicycle infrastructure network quality.
                   Bicycle infrastructure maps were collected for 74
                   cities with populations over 100,000 in the United
                   States and systematically analyzed to measure network
                   structure in each of these cities. Five categories of
                   network structure variables: size, connectivity,
                   directness, 36 fragmentation, and fragment size; are
                   used in regression models to test their relationship
                   with 37 bicycle commuting mode share. The models
                   revealed that connectivity and directness are 38
                   important factors in predicting bicycle commuting
                   after controlling for demographic variables 39 and
                   the size of the city. These findings provide a
                   framework for transportation planners and 40
                   policymakers to evaluate their local bicycle facility
                   networks and set regional priorities that 41 support

                   compare the cycle infrastructure in selected European
                   cities against an adapted Level of Service concept
                   using accompanied ride-alongs. The literature review
                   on the factors that encourage/dissuade cycle use
                   suggests that it is the potential rider's perceptions
                   on the safety of cycling in their neighbourhood that

                   cycling levels has increased significantly over the
                   last 20 years --- with the strongest growth since
                   2010. The research has evolved from the study of
                   lanes and paths, to include analyses of the role of
                   intersection treatments, and finally to studies that
                   attempt to measure the whole bike network. Most
                   studies suggest a positive relationship between
                   bikeway networks or aspects of the network and
                   cycling levels. Stated and revealed-preference
                   studies suggest a hierarchy of cyclist and
                   non-cyclist preferences may exist, favoring separate
                   paths and/or lanes over cycling on roadways with

                   However, there are some limitations to the current
                   urban planning/street network analysis literature. To
                   address these challenges, this study presents a new
                   tool to make the collection of data and creation and
                   analysis of street networks simple, consistent, and
                   automatable. OSMnx is a new Python package that
                   downloads administrative boundary shapes and street
                   networks from OpenStreetMap. OSMnx contributes five
                   significant new capabilities for researchers and city
                   planners: first, the automatic downloading of
                   administrative place boundaries and shapefiles;
                   second, the tailored and automated downloading and
                   constructing of street networks from OpenStreetMap
                   (including driving, walking, biking, etc.); third,
                   the automated correction and simplification of
                   network topology; fourth, the ability to save street
                   networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG
                   files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street
                   networks, calculate routes, project and visualize the
                   networks, and calculate network metrics and
                   statistics. These metrics and statistics include both
                   those common in urban design and transportation

	Abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications,
                   the most striking example of a geographical
                   application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM
                   aims to create a free digital map of the world and is
                   implemented through the engagement of participants in
                   a mode similar to software development in Open Source
                   projects. The information is collected by many
                   participants, collated on a central database, and
                   distributed in multiple digital formats through the
                   World Wide Web. This type of information was termed
                   'Volunteered Geographical Information' (VG!) by
                   Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no
                   systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study
                   aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information.
                   The examination focuses on analysis of its quality
                   through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS)
                   datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England,
                   since OSM started in London in August 2004 and
                   therefore the study of these geographies provides the
                   best understanding of the achievements and
                   difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM
                   information can be fairly accurate: on average within
                   about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and
                   with approximately 80{\%} overlap of motorway objects
                   between the two datasets. In the space of four years,
                   OSM has captured about 29{\%} of the area of England,
                   of which approximately 24{\%} are digitised lines
                   without a complete set of attributes. The paper
                   concludes with a discussion of the implications of
                   the findings to the study of VGI as well as
                   suggesting future research directions.},

                   (VGI) has recently emerged from the new Web 2.0
                   technologies. The OpenStreetMap project is currently
                   the most significant example of a system based on
                   VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic
                   databases using contributions from Internet users.
                   Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in
                   this context of freely downloadable geographic
                   databases. This article studies the quality of French
                   OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to
                   France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality
                   element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute,
                   semantic and temporal accuracy, logical con-
                   sistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses
                   different methods of quality control. The outcome of
                   the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity
                   of processes, scales of production, and the
                   compliance to standardized and accepted
                   specifications. In order to improve data quality, a
                   balance has to be struck between the contributors'
                   freedom and their respect of specifications. The
                   development of appropriate solutions to provide this
                   balance is an important research issue in the domain

                   access, and potential for future develop-ments.
                   OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative global map
                   that was built by volunteers and ispromising for
                   active transportation research. In this article, we
                   use OSM to inventory bicyclinginfrastructure in six
                   Canadian cities, compare it to municipal open data,
                   and provide guidance forpractitioners using OSM data.
                   We conducted an evaluation of OSM and open data,
                   overall and forfour categories of bicycle
                   infrastructure: cycle tracks; on-street bicycle
                   lanes; paths (bicycle only ormultiuse); and local
                   street bikeways. We found that the concordance in
                   terms of total length ofOSM infrastructure to open
                   data infrastructure very high in two of the six
                   cities ({\textless}$\pm$2{\%}), and rea-sonably high
                   in all cities (maximum difference $\pm$30{\%}).
                   Concordance for infrastructure categorieswas highest
                   for on-street bicycle lanes, which were the most
                   common, and easily identifiable typeof bicycle
                   infrastructure in the OSM data, and lowest for cycle
                   tracks and local street bikeways,both of which are
                   new or relatively rare infrastructure types in some
                   Canadian cities. In somecases, OSM was more detailed
                   and timely than open data. A challenge in OSM is
                   consistent tag-ging of bicycle infrastructure types.
                   We encourage practitioners to consider OSM data for
                   multicitystudies, but to be mindful of potential
                   inconsistencies in attribution and local definitions.

                   biological to technological, and social systems.
                   However, up until recently, attention was almost
                   exclusively given to networks in which all components

                   patterns that can encompass multiple types of
                   relationships, change in time and include other types
                   of complications. Such systems include multiple
                   subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is
                   important to take such `multilayer' features into
                   account to try to improve our understanding of
                   complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to
                   generalize `traditional' network theory by developing
                   (and validating) a framework and associated tools to
                   study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion.
                   The origins of such efforts date back several decades
                   and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study
                   of multilayer networks has become one of the most
                   important directions in network science. In this
                   paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks
                   (and related concepts) and review the exploding body
                   of work on such networks. To unify the disparate
                   terminology in the large body of recent work, we
                   discuss a general framework for multilayer networks,
                   construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the
                   numerous existing concepts to each other and provide
                   a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and
                   translates between related notions such as multilayer
                   networks, multiplex networks, interdependent
                   networks, networks of networks and many others. We
                   also survey and discuss existing data sets that can

	Abstract = {What do societies, the Internet, and the human brain
                   have in common? They are all examples of complex
                   relational systems, whose emerging behaviours are
                   largely determined by the non-trivial networks of
                   interactions among their constituents, namely
                   individuals, computers, or neurons, rather than the
                   properties of the units themselves. In the last two
                   decades, network scientists have proposed models of
                   increasing complexity to better understand real-world
                   systems. Only recently we have realised that
                   multiplexity, i.e. the coexistence of several types
                   of interactions among the constituents of a complex
                   system, is responsible for substantial qualitative
                   and quantitative differences in the type and variety
                   of behaviours that a complex system can exhibit. As a
                   consequence, multilayer and multiplex networks have
                   become a hot topic in complexity science. Here we
                   provide an overview of some of the measures proposed
                   so far to characterise the structure of multiplex
                   networks, and a selection of models aiming at
                   reproducing those structural properties and
                   quantifying their statistical significance. Focusing
                   on a subset of relevant topics, this brief review is
                   a quite comprehensive introduction to the most basic
                   tools for the analysis of multiplex networks observed
                   in the real-world. The wide applicability of
                   multiplex networks as a framework to model complex
                   systems in different fields, from biology to social
                   sciences, and the colloquial tone of the paper will
                   make it an interesting read for researchers working
                   on both theoretical and experimental analysis of

	Abstract = {The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and
                   territorial cases has a long tradition especially in
                   transportation/land-use planning and economic
                   geography. More recently, urban design has brought
                   its con-tribution by means of the " space syntax "
                   methodology. All these approaches -- though under
                   different terms like " accessibility " , " proximity
                   " , " integration " " connectivity " , " cost " or "
                   effort " -- focus on the idea that some places (or
                   streets) are more important than others because they
                   are more central. The study of centrality in complex
                   systems, however, originated in other scientific
                   areas, namely in structural sociology, well before
                   its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural
                   property of the system, centrality has never been
                   extensively investigated metrically in geographic
                   networks as it has been topologically in a wide range
                   of other relational networks like social, biological
                   or technological. After two previous works on some
                   structural properties of the dual and primal graph
                   representations of urban street networks (Porta et
                   al. 2004; Crucitti et al. 2005), in this paper we
                   provide an in-depth investiga-tion of centrality in
                   the primal approach as compared to the dual one, with
                   a special focus on potentials for urban design. An
                   innovative methodology for the analysis of geographic
                   spatial networks, which we term Multiple Centrality
                   Assessment (MCA), is defined and experimented on four
                   real urban street systems. MCA, it turns out,
                   provides a new perspective to the network analysis of
                   spatial systems, which is inherently differ-ent from
                   space syntax in that: 1. it is based on a primal,
                   rather than a dual, graph representation of street
                   pat-terns; 2. it works within a fully metric, rather
                   than topologic, framework; 3. it investigates a set
                   of peer cen-trality indices rather than just a
                   principal one. We show that spatially, some
                   centrality indices nicely capture the " skeleton " of
                   the urban structure that so much impacts on spatial
                   cognition and collective behaviors; we also show that
                   statistically, centrality distributions consistently
                   characterize geographically different patterns, and
                   power laws emerge in self-organized cities.},

                   quantitative characterisation is still inadequate. We
                   report here the empirical analysis of a unique data
                   set regarding almost 200 years of evolution of the
                   road network in a large area located north of Milan
                   (Italy). We find that urbanisation is characterised
                   by the homogenisation of cell shapes, and by the
                   stability throughout time of high-centrality roads
                   which constitute the backbone of the urban structure,
                   confirming the importance of historical paths. We
                   show quantitatively that the growth of the network is
                   governed by two elementary processes: (i)
                   `densification', corresponding to an increase in the
                   local density of roads around existing urban centres
                   and (ii) `exploration', whereby new roads trigger the
                   spatial evolution of the urbanisation front. The
                   empirical identification of such simple elementary
                   mechanisms suggests the existence of general, simple
                   properties of urbanisation and opens new directions

                   serious limitations to the possibility of modelling
                   the dynamics of cities. An example is the city of
                   Paris (France), which during the 19th century
                   experienced large modifications supervised by a
                   central authority, the 'Haussmann period'. In this
                   article, we report an empirical analysis of more than
                   200 years (1789-2010) of the evolution of the street
                   network of Paris. We show that the usual network
                   measures display a smooth behavior and that the most
                   important quantitative signatures of central planning
                   is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the
                   modification of the block shape distribution. Such

                   modifications at a large-scale level, with the
                   creation of new roads not constrained by the existing
                   geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to
                   result from the superimposition of continuous, local

	Abstract = {The growth of transportation networks and their
                   increasing interconnections, although positive, has
                   the downside effect of an increasing complexity which
                   make them difficult to use, to assess, and limits
                   their efficiency. On average in the UK, 23{\%} of
                   travel time is lost in connections for trips with
                   more than one mode, and the lack of synchronization
                   decreases very slowly with population size. This lack
                   of synchronization between modes induces differences
                   between the theoretical quickest trip and the
                   'time-respecting' path, which takes into account
                   waiting times at interconnection nodes. We analyse
                   here the statistics of these paths on the multilayer,
                   temporal network of the entire, multimodal british
                   public transportation system. We propose a

                   in urban areas, in terms of riding, waiting and
                   walking times, and which shows how the temporal
                   structure of trips varies with distance and allows us
                   to compare different cities. Weaknesses in systems
                   can be either insufficient transportation speed or
                   service frequency, but the key parameter controlling
                   their global efficiency is the total number of stop
                   events per hour for all modes. This analysis suggests
                   the need for better optimization strategies, adapted

                   inherent social and economic interactions. Mediating
                   the movements of people and resources, urban street
                   networks offer a spatial footprint of these
                   activities; consequently their structural
                   characteristics have been of great interest in the
                   literature. In comparison, relatively limited
                   attention has been devoted to the interplay between
                   street structure and its functional usage, i.e., the
                   movement patterns of people and resources. To address
                   this, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally
                   optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated
                   cities in the world. The routes are sampled in a
                   geographically unbiased way such that their
                   properties can be mapped on to each city, with their
                   summary statistics capturing mesoscale connectivity
                   patterns representing the complete space of possible
                   movement in cities. The collective morphology of
                   routes exhibits a directional bias that could be
                   described as influenced by the attractive (or
                   repulsive) forces resulting from congestion,
                   accessibility and travel demand that relate to
                   various socioeconomic factors. To capture this
                   feature, we propose a simple metric, inness, that
                   maps this force field. An analysis of the
                   morphological patterns of individual cities reveals
                   structural and socioeconomic commonalities among
                   cities with similar inness patterns, in particular
                   that they cluster into groups that are correlated
                   with their size and putative stage of urban
                   development as measured by a series of socioeconomic
                   and infrastructural indicators. Our results lend
                   weight to the insight that levels of urban
                   socioeconomic development are intrinsically tied to
                   increasing physical connectivity and diversity of

	Abstract = {There is growing interest in multiplex networks where
                   individual nodes take part in several layers of
                   networks simultaneously. This is the case, for
                   example, in social networks where each individual
                   node has different kinds of social ties or
                   transportation systems where each location is
                   connected to another location by different types of
                   transport. Many of these multiplexes are
                   characterized by a significant overlap of the links
                   in different layers. In this paper we introduce a
                   statistical mechanics framework to describe multiplex
                   ensembles. A multiplex is a system formed by N nodes
                   and M layers of interactions where each node belongs
                   to the M layers at the same time. Each layer $\alpha$
                   is formed by a network G$\alpha$. Here we introduce
                   the concept of correlated multiplex ensembles in
                   which the existence of a link in one layer is
                   correlated with the existence of a link in another
                   layer. This implies that a typical multiplex of the
                   ensemble can have a significant overlap of the links
                   in the different layers. Moreover, we characterize
                   microcanonical and canonical multiplex ensembles
                   satisfying respectively hard and soft constraints and
                   we discuss how to construct multiplexes in these
                   ensembles. Finally, we provide the expression for the
                   entropy of these ensembles that can be useful to
                   address different inference problems involving
                   multiplexes.},

	Abstract = {Many real-world complex systems consist of a set of
                   elementary units connected by relationships of
                   different kinds. All such systems are better
                   described in terms of multiplex networks, where the
                   links at each layer represent a different type of
                   interaction between the same set of nodes, rather
                   than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this
                   paper we present a general framework to describe and
                   study multiplex networks, whose links are either
                   unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a
                   series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity
                   of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link
                   properties such as the node degree, and the edge
                   overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such
                   as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity,
                   iii) global properties related to the navigability of
                   the multiplex across the different layers. The
                   measures we introduce are validated on a genuine
                   multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where
                   information among 78 individuals are recorded with
                   respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged
                   communications and business relationships.},

	Abstract = {In the last decade, network science has shed new
                   light both on the structural (anatomical) and on the
                   functional (correlations in the activity)
                   connectivity among the different areas of the human
                   brain. The analysis of brain networks has made
                   possible to detect the central areas of a neural
                   system, and to identify its building blocks by
                   looking at overabundant small subgraphs, known as
                   motifs. However, network analysis of the brain has so
                   far mainly focused on anatomical and functional
                   networks as separate entities. The recently developed
                   mathematical framework of multi-layer networks allows
                   to perform an analysis of the human brain where the
                   structural and functional layers are considered
                   together. In this work we describe how to classify
                   the subgraphs of a multiplex network, and we extend
                   motif analysis to networks with an arbitrary number
                   of layers. We then extract multi-layer motifs in
                   brain networks of healthy subjects by considering
                   networks with two layers, anatomical and functional,
                   respectively obtained from diffusion and functional
                   magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicate that
                   subgraphs in which the presence of a physical
                   connection between brain areas (links at the
                   structural layer) coexists with a non-trivial
                   positive correlation in their activities are
                   statistically overabundant. Finally, we investigate
                   the existence of a reinforcement mechanism between
                   the two layers by looking at how the probability to
                   find a link in one layer depends on the intensity of
                   the connection in the other one. Showing that
                   functional connectivity is non-trivially constrained
                   by the underlying anatomical network, our work
                   contributes to a better understanding of the
                   interplay between structure and function in the human
                   brain.},

	Abstract = {Mobility is fundamental to economic and social
                   activities, including commuting, manufacturing, or
                   supplying energy. Each movement has an origin, a
                   potential set of intermediate locations, a
                   destination, and a nature which is linked with
                   geographical attributes. Transport systems composed
                   of infrastructures, modes and terminals are so
                   embedded in the socio-economic life of individuals,
                   institutions and corporations that they are often
                   invisible to the consumer. This is paradoxical as the
                   perceived invisibility of transportation is derived
                   from its efficiency. Understanding how mobility is
                   linked with geography is main the purpose of this
                   textbook. The second edition of The Geography of
                   Transport Systems maintains the overall structure of
                   its predecessor, with chapters dealing with specific
                   conceptual dimensions and methodologies, but the
                   contents have been revised and updated. The second
                   edition also offers new topics and approaches that
                   have emerged as critical issues in contemporary
                   transport systems, including security, energy, supply
                   chain management and GIS-T. Relevant case studies
                   have also been included in the second edition to
                   underline real world issues related to transport
                   geography. Some key points of the second edition:
                   updated and revised conceptual and methodological
                   material to reflect the most current issues in
                   transport geography. a case study for each chapter
                   addressing a real world transportation geography
                   issue. reorganization of the text to improve

                   figures and maps. continuously updated and revised
                   supporting web site. Mainly aimed at an undergraduate
                   audience, this edition of The Geography of Transport
                   Systems provides a comprehensive and accessible
                   introduction to the field with a broad overview of
                   its concepts, methods and areas of application. It is

	Abstract = {We propose a quantitative method to classify cities
                   according to their street pattern. We use the
                   conditional probability distribution of shape factor
                   of blocks with a given area and define what could
                   constitute the 'fingerprint' of a city. Using a
                   simple hierarchical clustering method, these
                   fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology
                   of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131
                   cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of
                   the dendrogram, we observe four large families of
                   cities characterized by different abundances of
                   blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level
                   of the classification, we find that most European
                   cities and American cities in our sample fall in
                   their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively
                   the differences between the typical layouts of cities
                   in both regions. We also show with the example of New
                   York and its different boroughs, that the fingerprint
                   of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones
                   characterizing the different neighbourhoods inside a
                   city. This method provides a quantitative comparison
                   of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for
                   a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms

	Abstract = {Demarcating on-street bicycle facilities is often
                   mentioned as an important strategy to encourage
                   increased bicycle safety and bicycle travel. However,
                   little if any literature has focused on instances
                   where separate on-street bicycle facilities end. This
                   paper better understands the severity of such
                   instances and corresponding physical characteristics.
                   We identify 30 discontinuities of on-street bicycle
                   lanes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and collect primary
                   data measuring their physical attributes and
                   cyclists' perceptions of the level of comfort while
                   cycling through each. Using multi-variate analysis,
                   the findings suggest that discontinuities ending on
                   the left side of the street, with increased distance
                   of crossing intersections, having parking after the
                   discontinuities, and wider width of the curb lane are
                   statistical elements that contribute to higher levels
                   of discomfort. Such analysis is useful in determining
                   bicyclists' comfort level where discontinuities exist
                   and such methods can be an important part of an

@article{Reynolds2009,
	Abstract = {Background. Bicycling has the potential to improve
                   fitness, diminish obesity, and reduce noise, air
                   pollution, and greenhouse gases associated with
                   travel. However, bicyclists incur a higher risk of
                   injuries requiring hospitalization than motor vehicle
                   occupants. Therefore, understanding ways of making
                   bicycling safer and increasing rates of bicycling are
                   important to improving population health. There is a
                   growing body of research examining transportation
                   infrastructure and the risk of injury to bicyclists.
                   Methods. We reviewed studies of the impact of
                   transportation infrastructure on bicyclist safety.
                   The results were tabulated within two categories of
                   infrastructure, namely that at intersections (e.g.
                   roundabouts, traffic lights) or between intersections
                   on "straightaways" (e.g. bike lanes or paths). To
                   assess safety, studies examining the following
                   outcomes were included: injuries; injury severity;
                   and crashes (collisions and/or falls). Results. The
                   literature to date on transportation infrastructure
                   and cyclist safety is limited by the incomplete range
                   of facilities studied and difficulties in controlling
                   for exposure to risk. However, evidence from the 23
                   papers reviewed (eight that examined intersections
                   and 15 that examined straightaways) suggests that
                   infrastructure influences injury and crash risk.
                   Intersection studies focused mainly on roundabouts.
                   They found that multi-lane roundabouts can
                   significantly increase risk to bicyclists unless a
                   separated cycle track is included in the design.
                   Studies of straightaways grouped facilities into few
                   categories, such that facilities with potentially
                   different risks may have been classified within a
                   single category. Results to date suggest that
                   sidewalks and multi-use trails pose the highest risk,
                   major roads are more hazardous than minor roads, and
                   the presence of bicycle facilities (e.g. on-road bike
                   routes, on-road marked bike lanes, and off-road bike
                   paths) was associated with the lowest risk.
                   Conclusion. Evidence is beginning to accumulate that
                   purpose-built bicycle-specific facilities reduce
                   crashes and injuries among cyclists, providing the
                   basis for initial transportation engineering
                   guidelines for cyclist safety. Street lighting, paved
                   surfaces, and low-angled grades are additional
                   factors that appear to improve cyclist safety. Future
                   research examining a greater variety of
                   infrastructure would allow development of more
                   detailed guidelines. {\textcopyright} 2009 Reynolds

                   odds ratio [OR] = 0.11; 95{\%} confidence interval
                   [CI] = 0.02, 0.54), about one ninth the risk of the
                   reference: major streets with parked cars and no bike
                   infrastructure. Risks on major streets were lower
                   without parked cars (adjusted OR = 0.63; 95{\%} CI =
                   0.41, 0.96) and with bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.54;
                   95{\%} CI = 0.29, 1.01). Local streets also had lower
                   risks (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95{\%} CI = 0.31, 0.84).
                   Other infrastructure characteristics were associated
                   with increased risks: streetcar or train tracks
                   (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95{\%} CI = 1.8, 5.1), downhill
                   grades (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95{\%} CI = 1.7, 3.1), and
                   construction (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95{\%} CI = 1.3,
                   2.9). CONCLUSIONS: The lower risks on quiet streets
                   and with bike-specific infrastructure along busy
                   streets support the route-design approach used in
                   many northern European countries. Transportation
                   infrastructure with lower bicycling injury risks
                   merits public health support to reduce injuries and
                   promote cycling.},

                   (Brisbane, Australia) and an established cycling city
                   (Copenhagen, Denmark). Perceptions and reported

                   web-based survey administered among cyclists in the
                   two cities. Elicited items concerned perceived risk
                   of infrastructure layouts, fear of traffic, cycling
                   while distracted, use of safety gear, cycling
                   avoidance due to feeling unsafe, and avoidance to

                   infrastructure layouts as less safe, feel more fear

                   avoidance as a coping strategy. Results also show
                   that cyclists in Copenhagen tend to use less helmets

                   promoted by many governments all over the world. As a
                   result, constructing effective bike lanes has become
                   a crucial task for governments promoting the cycling
                   life style, as well-planned bike paths can reduce
                   traffic congestion and decrease safety risks for both
                   cyclists and motor vehicle drivers. Unfortunately,
                   existing trajectory mining approaches for bike lane
                   planning do not consider key realistic government
                   constraints: 1) budget limitations, 2) construction
                   convenience, and 3) bike lane utilization. In this
                   paper, we propose a data-driven approach to develop
                   bike lane construction plans based on large-scale
                   real world bike trajectory data. We enforce these
                   constraints to formulate our problem and introduce a
                   flexible objective function to tune the benefit
                   between coverage of the number of users and the
                   length of their trajectories. We prove the
                   NP-hardness of the problem and propose greedy-based
                   heuristics to address it. Finally, we deploy our

                   bicycle network design. The model takes into account
                   interests of the users (who travel along shortest
                   paths) and the planners (available budget). An
                   underlying network composed by street segments
                   suitable to build cycling infrastructure is taken as
                   input. Each network link has construction and user
                   cost, both proportional to the distance. A network
                   link without cycling infrastructure which is part of
                   a path followed by users, has a larger user cost. A
                   multi-commodity network flow mixed-integer
                   mathematical program is proposed and applied to
                   small-sized problem instances to validate the model.
                   The formulation considers the discontinuities of the
                   bicycle network, i.e. the users' paths which include
                   segments without cycling infrastructure. Sensitivity
                   analysis are performed with respect to budget levels
                   and to penalization of user's cost in links without
                   cycling infrastructure. A metaheuristic is proposed
                   to handle large-sized instances. As an additional
                   feature (difficult to formulate in the exact model),
                   the metaheuristic also minimizes the total number of
                   discontinuities by including them into the objective
                   function. The accuracy of the metaheuristic is
                   estimated by comparing with exact results when
                   possible. The methodology is tested using data from
                   the city of Montevideo, Uruguay, including a
                   large-sized underlying street network and
                   origin-destination trips estimated from a household
                   survey. Computational results are obtained with and

                   network is abstracted. In this network, nodes are the
                   origins and destinations of taxi trips and the number
                   of trips among them is abstracted as link weights.
                   Data is extracted from the Taxi smart card system of
                   a real city. Then, Communities i.e. clusters of this
                   network are detected using a modularity maximization
                   method. Each community contains the nodes with
                   highest number of trips within the cluster and lowest
                   number of trips with other clusters. Within each

                   share of up to 24.7{\%} in European cities. The
                   all-streets scenario (S4) produced greatest benefits
                   through increases in cycling for London with 1,210
                   premature deaths (95{\%} CI: 447--1,972) avoidable
                   annually, followed by Rome (433; 95{\%} CI:
                   170--695), Barcelona (248; 95{\%} CI: 86--410),
                   Vienna (146; 95{\%} CI: 40--252), Zurich (58; 95{\%}
                   CI: 16--100) and Antwerp (7; 95{\%} CI: 3--11). The
                   largest cost--benefit ratios were found for the
                   10{\%} increase in cycling networks (S1). If all 167
                   European cities achieved a cycling mode share of
                   24.7{\%} over 10,000 premature deaths could be
                   avoided annually. In European cities, expansions of
                   cycling networks were associated with increases in
                   cycling and estimated to provide health and economic
                   benefits.},
