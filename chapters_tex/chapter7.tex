\section{Data-driven strategies for optimal bicycle network growth}
\subsection{Data}

Figure \ref{fig:Nodes} shows the connected component size distribution $P(N_{cc})$ for all considered layers and cities.

\subsection{Bicycle network improvement}\label{SI:BikeImprovement}

Here we show the improvement of the bicycle network after the implementation of the algorithms. We measure the improvement with four different metrics. Two of them implement the notion of connectedness: i) Fraction of nodes inside the largest connected component compared to the total number of nodes in the bicycle layer, and ii) the fraction of link kilometers inside the largest connected component. In Figure \ref{fig:NodesIncrease} and \ref{fig:LengthsIncrease} we show these two measures for fourteen different cities. We also quantify iii) bicycle-to-car directness to answer the question ``how direct are the average routes of bicycles compared to cars?''. Finally, in order to measure the cumulative efficiency of our algorithms, we define the metric: iv) $G_{LCC}$ as the relative gain of bicycle path kilometers in the largest connected component. In Figures \ref{fig:Directness} and \ref{fig:Gain} we report these two measures for all algorithms and cities considered.

\subsection{Bicycle network and 30 km/h streets}\label{SI:BikeStreets}
We applied the algorithms to the bicycle infrastructure and all the bike friendly streets, those with a speed limit of $30\ km/h$ or less (see Figures~\ref{fig:NodesIncrease_BikeStreets}, \ref{fig:Lengthsncrease_BikeStreets}, \ref{fig:Directness_BikeStreets}, and \ref{fig:Gain_BikeStreets}).

% \subsection{Weights used in the calculations}
% The weights of the different $Q$ indices in the final aggregation as well as in sub-categories highly depends on the context and the nature of the problem. Here we present the values we used to generate the results of this study, that were agreed upon consulting with experts.

% The weights of the sub-indices from equation (\ref{final_Q}) are of the following values:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $w^{\text{services}}=0.7$;
%   \item $w^{\text{safety}}=0.1$;
%   \item $w^{\text{environment}}=0.2$
% \end{itemize}

% The category weights used in equation (\ref{Q_services}), aggregating $Q^{services}$ are:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $w^{\text{family}}= 0.3$;
%   \item $w^{\text{health}}= 0.3$;
%   \item $w^{\text{culture}} = 0.15$;
%   \item $w^{\text{sport}} = 0.15$;
%   \item $w^{\text{night life}}=0.1$
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Categorization}\label{SI:LQIcategories}
The amenities used for each category are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Culture
