\subsection{Weights used in the calculations}
The weights of the different $Q$ indices in the final aggregation as well as in sub-categories highly depends on the context and the nature of the problem. Here we present the values we used to generate the results of this study, that were agreed upon consulting with experts.\\
The weights of the sub-indices from equation (\ref{final_Q}) are of the following values:\\
$w^{services}=0.7$\\
$w^{safety}=0.1$\\
$w^{environment}=0.2$\\ \\
The category weights used in equation (\ref{Q_services}), aggregating $Q^{services}$ are:\\
$w^{family}= 0.3$;\\
$w^{health}= 0.3$;\\
$w^{culture} = 0.15$;\\
$w^{sport} = 0.15$;\\
$w^{night life}=0.1$;\\
