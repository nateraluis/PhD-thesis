In the overlap census, the vertical red line gives a visual separation of the left from the right half where nodes become active in the street layer. High spikes in the right half indicate car-centricity. \textbf {(b)} Clusters of cities based on similarity of their overlap census. We find six different clusters using a k-means algorithm (coloured areas), which explain more than $90\%$ of the variance. \textbf {(c)} Overlap census for cities in each cluster. The first one corresponds to Amsterdam (the city with most active nodes in bicycle-only configurations). The Copenhagen-Manhattan-Barcelona-Portland city cluster has many active nodes in pedestrian-only and bicycle-only configurations, representing an active mobility city. The clusters of Los Angeles-Bogota and Mexico-Beihai-Jakarta are car-centric.\relax }}{4}{figure.caption.8}%

The network was built following a primal approach, where the edges are sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure, and nodes are intersections. \textbf {(b)} The graph-Voronoi tessellation of the Budapest network, generated using a subset of 15 parks as seeds. The color of the nodes represents the cell they belong to and the highlighted red dots are the seeds of each cell. The distance measure between two points is defined as the weighted shortest path on the graph, the weights being the average time required to cross a given edge.\relax }}{10}{figure.caption.9}%
