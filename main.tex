\chapter*{Abstract}
With more than half of the world's population living in cities, it is fundamentally important to understand how the complex system of urban mobility infrastructure, from sidewalks and bicycle paths to streets and rails, shapes and modifies human mobility. In this thesis, we use network science to study cities and their mobility infrastructures. We treat these infrastructures as layers of a multiplex network, such as sidewalks, bicycle paths, subway systems and streets, and develop and apply network science based tools to study these layers both individually and jointly. First, we survey the existing literature of cities as multiplex networks, from infrastructure and dynamics to existing measures, data and analysis tools. Second, we propose a new method to extract the multimodal profile from a city's multiplex transport network. We show how this method can be applied to identify multimodal similarities between cities. Third, we focus on the bicycle layer of the multimodal network, investigate its structure, and find that it consists of hundreds of disconnected patches. To connect these patches, we develop and apply data-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies, showing that small but focused investments allow to significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle networks. In the fourth chapter, we present a data-driven, network-based method to quantify the livability of a city, computing pedestrian accessibility to amenities and services, taking into consideration safety and environmental variables. Finally, we discuss the main contributions of this thesis and outline possible applications and open questions for the future. We anticipate that this work contributes directly to the understanding of urban systems providing new insights and tools for the evaluation of sustainable urban mobility infrastructures. Understanding, improving, and evaluating urban mobility infrastructures are major steps for improving urban life and to plan ahead of climate change, thus a well-defined set of tools and metrics will be relevant to move forward.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
The entire process of a doctoral program and dissertation involves an incredible support network. I would like to thank and acknowledge several people that have, whether realizing it or not, influenced this work. First, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisors Michaell Szell and Federico Battiston, for their tireless, caring support in this endeavor. Their guidance has been invaluable. I thank Gerardo I\~niguez for his contributions, guidance, and support.

I thank my friends and colleagues from the Department of Network and Data Science: J\'ulia Perczel, Orsolya V\'as\'arhelyi, D\'avid Deritei, Rebeka O. Szab\'o, Matteo Neri, Manran Zhu, Milan Janosov for their friendship and support during the Ph.D. They, along with the rest of the department, including Olga Peredi, the other Ph.D. students, faculty, postdocs, and visitors, provided a fun and stimulating environment. Special thanks to Agnes Toth from the Center for Academic Writing for her insightful comments.

My appreciation goes to my former mentors who set me on this path: Rosy Laguna, for planting the seed to view the world through numbers. Sandra Vald\'es, Pedro Alcocer, and Alfredo Hidalgo for setting me on a path to understand, plan and build better cities. Rossana Reguillo, thank you for helping me have my first steps into academic research.

I thank all my friends for your kind encouragement, patience, and support. It was essential to keep me sane during the last four years. Thank you, Jorge, Susana, Juan Carlos, Alejandro, Diana, Pily, Gabriel, Andrea, Andr\'es, Gaby, Juan Carlos, Javier, Ana, Juan Carlos, Juan Pablo, Luc\'ia, Alfredo, Alexa, Carlos, H\'ector and to the many, many others that have been there for me when needed. Thank you for your friendship.

I am fortunate to have two families supporting and rooting for me. I thank the Velasco Salcedo's, Gaby, Andrea, Gaby, and  Guillermo, for their unconditional love and support. To the Natera Orozco's, my parents, Lupita y Jaime, my brother, Jorge — you have provided me with incredible support, endless encouragement, and love. Gracias.

Most importantly, I want to thank Pau. She alone knows what went into this Ph.D. and thesis. How the road was, the lows and highs, the bumps along the road. This has been a shared journey. Her support, encouragement, and love have been essential to be here today. Pau — Thank you for this amazing ride that is life with you. I love you. This thesis is for you.
